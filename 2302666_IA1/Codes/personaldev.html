            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This page's dedication is to what was learnt after reading chapters 4 – 7 of “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chapter 4: Self Discipline</h2>
            <p>One essential component of success is self-discipline: Jim Rohn highlights in this chapter the need of self-discipline in attaining long-term objectives.
                When faced with challenges, it's simple to lose focus or give up when discipline is lacking.
                Big results are the outcome of small, regular actions: According to Rohn, self-control and little, everyday routines can 
                build up over time to produce notable success and personal development.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chapter 5: Personal Developement</h2>
            <p>Work on yourself more than on your career: The idea that success is mostly dependent on personal development is one of this chapter's most important lessons.
                 Gaining long-term success in any industry requires developing your abilities, knowledge, and perspective.
                Lifelong learning is crucial. The chapter emphasises how crucial it is to constantly strive to learn and develop.
                 Never stop improving yourself, whether it's from books, experiences, or mentoring.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chapter 6: Relationships</h2>
            <p>Success is mostly dependent on relationships: The book emphasises the value of forming deep, fulfilling connections with others on a personal and professional level. 
                Being in the company of driven and encouraging people can boost your spirits and provide you access to the network required for success.
                Serve others: Rohn also emphasises the value of establishing relationships based on mutual respect, trust, and benefit.
                Deeper, more profound connections and a sense of fulfilment are the results of serving others.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chapter 7: Setting Goals</h2>
            <p>Objectives provide guidance and meaning: the power of goal-setting is the subject of this chapter. Objectives that are precise and well-defined serve as a guide for reaching success in life, offering inspiration and guidance.
                Put your objectives in writing: Writing down precise, quantifiable, and time-bound goals is advised by Rohn. This makes your goals more clear and increases the process's actionability.
                Another important lesson is to visualise achievement. Readers are urged to see their accomplishment in vivid detail, which will help them stay focused on their objectives.
